# blanksy
Editor.js based note taking / meeting notes with w3.css styling.

Basically, this is the example from the Editor.js repo tailored to my personal needs. 

## About

blanksy is an application for taking notes / meeting minutes. It's based on Editor.js and works completely offline - you just need a browser. 

## Why

Because I like the way the Gutenberg block editor in Wordpress works (moving **blocks** up and down).

## Prequesites

blanksy.html file and the following folder structure. Please get the needed libraries from their respective websites.
